# Frontend Web Development Journey

Welcome to my Frontend Web Development Journey! This repository is a practical space where I document my progress and projects as I build hands-on experience in frontend development. Having acquired a strong theoretical understanding of web technologies, I am now focusing on translating that knowledge into practical skills.

## About Me

I am a budding frontend developer with a solid foundation in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I have a good grasp of the theoretical aspects, I aim to strengthen my practical knowledge by working on projects that challenge and refine my skills. This repository is a step toward achieving that goal by experimenting with designs, layouts, and interactivity.
